# Designthinking

I used Mural to storyboard and conceptualize a Nutrition App, mapping the user journey from selecting dietary preferences to enjoying a personalized meal. Through collaborative brainstorming, we identified key features like meal plan customization, dietary analysis, and progress tracking. Using techniques like "How Might We" questions, Hills statements, and voting sessions, we prioritized app functionalities and structured them into modular components for prototype development.
